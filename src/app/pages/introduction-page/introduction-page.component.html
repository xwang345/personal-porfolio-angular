    My name is Xiaochen Wang and I'm currently studying Computer Programming and 
    Analysis at Seneca College of Applied Arts & Technology. My Interests are 
    everything related to HTML, JavaScript and CSS and I'm currently in the 
    process of mastering the MEAN stack. It's my goal to become a full-steak 
    JavaScript developer and continue to lean and expand my experience to include 
    all the amazing new dev tools, enviroments, libraries, workflows and design 
    methodlogies available to the fill-stack / MEAN developer community.
